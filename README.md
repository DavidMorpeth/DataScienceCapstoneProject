# Introduction

SpaceX has revolutionised the space race by developing rockets at a fraction of the cost of conventional launches, it has done this by reusing the rockets landing them which saves in excess of $100 million dollars for each launch. 

The goal of this project is develop a predictive model that will not only improve the success rate but enable a cost effective pricing strategy to compete directly with SpaceX.
